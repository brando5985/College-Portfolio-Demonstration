# College-Portfolio-Demonstration
(A showcase of my FractionMatcher.java file, to be used in my college portfolio.)

FractionMatcher.java is used with input from the person opening the file. The user will be prompted to enter a decimal number after typing "java FractionMatcher" in the command terminal. The value decimal number is then matched to the fraction out of the "fractions.txt" file, which encompasses 80 different fractions, which has the closest value to the decimal number value inputted by the user. Comments are also demonstrated throughout the main "FractionMatcher.java" file in order to demonstrate how the code is able to match the inputted decimal value to the closest value found in the 80 fractions.

In order to effectively run FractionMatcher.java, both "fractions.txt" and "FractionMatcher.java" must be saved and compiled to the user's system. "java FractionMatcher" must then be inputted into the user's command terminal in order to begin the file demonstration, which can end when 0 is inputted by the user. Another file can be used in place of "fractions.txt" as well, if changes are made to the original source code in "FractionMatcher.java".
