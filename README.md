# College-Portfolio-Demonstration
(A showcase of my FractionMatcher.java file, to be used in my college portfolio.)

FractionMatcher.java is used with input from the person opening the file. The user will be prompted to enter a decimal number after typing "java FractionMatcher" in the command terminal. The value decimal number is then matched to the fraction out of the "fractions.txt" file, which encompasses 80 different fractions, which has the closest value to the decimal number value inputted by the user. Comments are also demonstrated throughout the main "FractionMatcher.java" file in order to demonstrate how the code is able to match the inputted decimal value to the closest value found in the 80 fractions.
